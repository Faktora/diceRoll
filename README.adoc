= Poker Dice


== Task Specification

Implement a simple poker dice link:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalero[game]. Two players roll 5 dices maximum 3 times per round and the points are summarized. First one to reach 100 points wins.

. **Main Task (40 points)**
  * Implement a program which allows two human players to play poker dice.
  * The game follows this principle:
  ** Player rolls 5 dice (rand function)
  ** Poker dice values are shown (9, 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace)
  ** Player chooses 0 to 5 dice that he wants to keep.
     Keeping all of them ends the player's turn.
     The other dice are rolled again.
  ** The player is allowed to select and re-throw the respective dice two times for a total number of up to three throws per turn.
     The values after the last throw count.
  * For each round the points are counted:
  ** 9s count one point
  ** 10s count two points
  ** Jacks count three points
  [...]
  ** Kings count five points
  ** Aces count six points


. **Task (15 points)**
+
  * Add additional point counting:
    ** Straight (the combination of 9, 10, J, Q, K or 10, J, Q, K, A) counts 20 points or 25 if done on the first roll
  ** Full House (three equal dice values + two other equal dice values e.g. 9+9+9+J+J) counts 30 points or 35 if done on the first roll
  ** Poker (four equal dice values e.g. Q+Q+Q+Q) counts 40 points or 45 if done on the first roll
  ** Grande (five equal dice values e.g. A+A+A+A+A) counts 50 points or 80 if done on the first roll

. **Task (15 points)**
+
  * Implement a counting table instead of the summary for the points.
In the table only one row value can be written per round.
  * Player has to choose which dice they want to write to the table after they finished their round.
  * Winner is again who reaches 100 Points.

  . **Task (20 points)**
+
  * Expand the counting table game mode for a special mode called "can must".
    The goal is to get each of the decks described above once.
  * During the can part each player can choose their row they want to write the values to.
  * A row of values can only be written once.
  * When the dice values can not be written any more the player has to choose a row which he will put a zero result into.
  * When all rows are filled (after 10 rounds) the second part starts.
  * This part starts with 9s where all Players have to reach as much 9s as possible. This value is then counted into the 9 row.
  * Next round will be 10s, then Jack, Queen, ...
  * Last round is Grande
  * After this part is finished all points are summarized and the player with most points wins.

. **Task (20 points)**
+
  * Implement a game mode called pyramid
  * The pyramid has one cell for a grande, two cells for poker, three cells for Full House etc, up to 10 cells for 9s
  * Gameplay is defined by these rules:
  ** The Player can choose which dice should be counted into the pyramid
  ** but only one row at a time e.g the dice show 9+9+J+Q+A then the player can select the two 9s, one Jack, one Queen or one Ace to be written into the pyramid.
  ** In the pyramid each cell is only marked as finished. If no value can be written then the round is not counted for this player.
  ** When a Player finishes all cells he/she win the game.


. **Task (25 points)**
+
  * Extend the program to use ncurses.
  Description how to use ncurses can be found link:https://embsys.technikum-wien.at/mio/bic/1/prg/download/ncurses.pdf[here].
  * Build the Playfield, Point summary or table or pyramid on the screen and only overwrite the changed parts.
