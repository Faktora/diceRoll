/// \param is_max - searches the array with player throws for the max element in it
/// \param if_fullhouse - takes a sorted player's throws array from is_highest and returns true if three and two of a
/// kind are found in player's throw array, false otherwise
/// \param is_poker - takes the sorted player's throws array and returns true if there are four of a kind, false otherwise
/// \param is_grande - checks the player's throw array if all dices are Aces
